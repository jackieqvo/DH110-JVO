You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/jackieqvo/jackieqvo/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files. Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Introduction ## 

This quarter’s focus was to create a UX project that would be able to help the senior age group. In our pre-class survey, we were asked to view websites that would be useful to the older generation. I decided to survey and study instructional websites. Ever since COVID-19, digital instruction has been the center of most learning and instructional mediums. With this, people are most likely in separation from those who are normally able to help and support them on their learning endeavors (big or small). 

## Design Statement ## 

Most of the time, instructional websites are content heavy and are tailored to the younger generation. They dismiss the possibility that everyone’s intake in information is different and thus, the content that they have can be overwhelming to some users. A lot of the times, they assign a credible author to the instructional guide and leave the article up with no additional aid. This might discourage people from learning and reading guides on their own. 

The UX project that I am designing is meant to be a start towards bridging the generational gaps and lapses in knowledge; by working towards a more accessible design that is inspired by established websites, I am aiming to create inclusive spaces that will overlook age groups and their technological abilities. Learning should be a right and not a privilege.


## Competitor Analysis ## 

**Information** | **wikiHow Evaluation** | **Dummies Evaluation**
--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------
**Website** | [wikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page) | [Dummies](https://www.dummies.com/)

**Presentation** | *wikiHow is a database of how-to-guides that consist of step-by-step instructions. These often consist of still and even animated images. The site is an open source that is typically found at the top of search results. The site's most popular article is "How to Take a Screenshot in Microsoft Windows," showing that the site is geared to help answer day-to-day questions. It is an open and free source that allows people to edit pages and articles.
* | *Dummies or For Dummies is a series of instructional guides. Dummies is best known for their distinctive books that are in the colors yellow and black. Their intention is to cover various topics and break down information that may appear to be intimidating for beginners. The website itself sports the same colors and a search bar that takes up most of the home page. Just like wikiHow, it is an open source.*
