# Bridging Generations: The Intersection of Digital Instruction and Tentative Questions #
## Assignment 08: Project Portfolio & Documentation ##
__Digital Humanities 110 | Jacqueline "Jackie" Vo__

Project portfolio presentation and documentation.

## Introduction ## 

This quarter’s focus was to create a UX project that would be able to help the senior age group. In our pre-class survey, we were asked to view websites that would be useful to the older generation. I decided to survey and study instructional websites. Ever since COVID-19, digital instruction has been the center of most learning and instructional mediums. With this, people are most likely in separation from those who are normally able to help and support them on their learning endeavors (big or small). 

## Design Statement ## 

Most of the time, instructional websites are content heavy and are tailored to the younger generation. They dismiss the possibility that everyone’s intake in information is different and thus, the content that they have can be overwhelming to some users. A lot of the times, they assign a credible author to the instructional guide and leave the article up with no additional aid. This might discourage people from learning and reading guides on their own. 

The UX project that I am designing is meant to be a start towards bridging the generational gaps and lapses in knowledge; by working towards a more accessible design that is inspired by established websites, I am aiming to create inclusive spaces that will overlook age groups and their technological abilities. Learning should be a right and not a privilege.


## Competitor Analysis ## 

**wikiHow Evaluation** | **Dummies Evaluation**

[wikiHow](https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page) | [Dummies](https://www.dummies.com/) |

**Summary of Evaluations**: While wikiHow's website is overall an accessible site with relevant functions. There are some issues that are important to fix but it is still overall a user-friendly site. Dummies is overall an accessible site with relevant functions. Despite some improvements and favorable options that wikiHow does not have, Dummies does lacks in areas that hurt their statement about being able to make information less intimidating. Although their guides are broken down from their books and are not as lengthy as that particular text, the lack of visuals and extra assistance can hurt learners that require more direction.

## User Research ## 

### Target Users ###

> **Demographics:** Anyone interested in learning about new skills and projects. People who are more inclined to learn on their own.
> 
> **Preferences:** Users who have the desire to learn and are looking for convenient resources to do so.
> 
> **Expertise:** Users do not need any particular level of expertise for this project.

The context of use for this project is that users will be able to learn how to make a greeting card. To complete this activity, users will be able to follow a set of instructions and a list of materials.

While the usability tests sheow me how someone might react and navitage to tasks on a website, a contextual inquiry gave the user more freedom to react to the website. 
Summary and link to your assignment folder. During the inquiry, I gave broad tasks so that my user would show me how they would normally navigate a website. Whenever she needs instructional guides, my user had a preference for websites with:

- Aesthetic visual presentation.
- Conciseness in content.
- Access to guides and answers in an efficient manner.

## UX Storytelling ##

By utilizing UX storytelling, I will be able to better understand the user's perspective and thus, continue to filter out potential biases and personal points that I may have held onto during the usability testing and the contextual inquiry interview. In addition to this, UX storytelling is able to build upon the data that is gathered from these interviews by pushes the focus onto the user. These methods are meant to be user-centered and a user's experience goes beyond their interaction with a website or program's design.

The two personas I focus on are August and Anne. While August is a academically oriented individual, Anne is someone that is someone who is only beginning to learn again. The two personas are on opposite ends of the spectrum. With these personas and scenarios in mind, I would be able to visualize how to best help various users. Putting the user's thoughts and goals into perspective will help highlight potential problems with the website and program. Through this, I can better empathize with their personalized stories.
